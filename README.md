# Xod 🧮

A tiny REPL for bitwise arithmetic and expression evaluation.

Xod is a minimal scripting language and interactive REPL designed for experimenting with bitwise logic and integer math. Think of it as a scratchpad for systems engineers, embedded developers, and anyone who needs to test bitwise operations in a focused, rule-consistent environment.

## ✨ Features

- Evaluate bitwise and arithmetic expressions interactively.
- Integer-only logic with no floating point or negative values.
- Support for basic list manipulation and iteration.
- Familiar control flow with if, while, and for blocks.
- Hex, octal, binary, and decimal formatting.
- Simple built-in commands like help(), clear(), and history().

## 🧠 Language Overview

### Xod supports:

- Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, +, -, \*, /, %, \*\*
- Booleans: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
- List Methods: append, prepend, front, back, index
- Builtin Commands: hex(), bin(), log(base, value), range(start, end), etc.
- Control Flow:

```c
for(x in range(1, 5)) { bin(x) }
if(3 & 1) { hex(3) }
while(x < 8) { x = x + 1 }
```

> 🛑 Floating point values and negative integers are not supported.

### ❗️Operator Precedence

To avoid ambiguity in bitwise expressions, parentheses are required to define precedence. For example:

```c
(a & b) | c   // ✅ Clear
a & b | c     // ❌ Error: ambiguous expression
```

## 🧪 Usage

Launch the REPL:

```bash
xod
```

Then type any expression:

```c
>> 3 & 6
2
>> hex(255)
0xff
>> for(x in range(0, 4)) { bin(x) }
0b0
0b1
0b10
0b11
```

## 🧰 Basic commands

- `help()` – Show help message
- `history()` – Show input history
- `clear()` – Clear the screen
- `quit()` – Exit the REPL

## 📦 Installation

Coming soon! For now, clone the repo and run it directly:

```bash
cargo install xod
```
